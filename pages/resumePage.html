                experience in developing responsive, user-friendly web applications, and a proven track record of
                delivering quality work on time. I am proficient in JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and various front-end
                frameworks. Additionally, I possess excellent communication and problem-solving skills and am committed
                to continuous learning and staying up-to-date with emerging technologies. I am passionate about
                leveraging my skills and creativity to contribute to the success of an innovative and dynamic team.

            <div class="project-head">PROJECT</div>
            <div class="project-body">Online Placement Agency (Jan 2023 – March 2023)
                Lead a team of 4 people. This is a full-stack project built using MERN stack that enables job seekers to
                search for job listings and apply to them, and employers to post job openings and search for potential
                candidates.
                The portal utilizes MongoDB to store job listings and user data, Express.js for backend development,
                React for frontend development, and Node.js to enable server-side logic and routing.
                By building this portal, I gained valuable experience in web development using the MERN stack, as well
                as skills in database management, server-side programming, and frontend design.
